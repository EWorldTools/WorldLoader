# About 
WL is just a little project i used for learning about Il2Cpp and System assembly stuff, This is inspired by [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/)

		Q : Should i use this inst- 
		A : no, any Il2cpp Manged Loader is going to be way better, Loaders like Bep and ML both have teams who actually learned coding, im just a bored 15yr
# Features

  - Inject At Anytime
  - Uses CLR          
  - (Theres more, i just hate typing)

# How To Install

Head Over to Releases, Down the .Zip file and Extraxt it into Any *IL2CPP UNITY* Game (MONO IS NOT SUPPORTED - Im lazy)
Use any dll injector to inti the CoreCLR Dll into the UNITY applaction, and it will do the rest from there

## How to use 

As WL Uses CLR, all u have to do is open a Clr inst in the Target Game, then invoke the start Methods
i've included a DLL project as an example, you can just use that with ur fav injector and call the Dll Attch
