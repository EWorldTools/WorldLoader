 (Not Ready Yet)

   
## Known Issues: 
        - Dup Class names in some games 
            [ This is due to the Gen Opt's ( TypeDeobfuscationMaxUniquifiers && TypeDeobfuscationCharsPerUniquifier ) Being set to 0 
                    ( CLR has the strings a lot smaller then how the CLI Sees it, thus causing the maps not work )
